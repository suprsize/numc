### Provide answers to the following questions for each set of partners.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 8hr
  - Task 2 (Writing the Python-C interface): 12hr
  - Task 3 (Speeding up matrix operations): 10hr
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>It was very interesting. I like that we learned about python interfacing into C.</b>
  - <b>Most interesting was to learn about threading and working on multiple data at the same time.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned about Python Environment.</b>
  - <b>How to do threading and getting more used to C</b>
  - <b>Learned about testing a C program by Python</b>
  - <b>Learned about timing a program.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>I think getting rid of sub and neg was a very good choice. It would have been just a repetitive work. </b>
  - <b>I think adding how much speed up to expect on how large a matrix would be a good idea.</b>
  - <b>Change the exponentiation link to the Wikipedia link or something more easy to read would be good choice.</b>
  - <b>Maybe for Task 2, similar to task 3 add all the useful function that we need</b>
  - <b>For testing add and example of catching an error type.</b>
  - <b>For PyNumber Struct add this link, it is great: https://py3c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext-types.html</b>
  - <b>For parallel threading say that the inner-most for-loop is going to be a slow-down.

### If you worked with a partner:
- In one short paragraph, describe your contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>I did everything on my own.</b>
  - <b>Did some testing, did some coding on matrix.c and numc.c</b>
- In one short paragraph, describe your partner's contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>My partner was a bum. He did nothing. </b>
  - <b>Just kidding I did the project solo.</b>
