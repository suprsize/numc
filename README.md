# numc

### Provide answers to the following questions for each set of partners.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 8hr
  - Task 2 (Writing the Python-C interface): 12hr
  - Task 3 (Speeding up matrix operations): 10hr
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>It was very interesting. I like that we learned about python interfacing into C.</b>
  - <b>Most interesting was to learn about threading and working on multiple data at the same time.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned about Python Environment.</b>
  - <b>Learned that pragma is going to slow down if used in inner loops and is only affective in outer-most loop</b>
  - <b>Learned that in SIMD masking is used to get around if statements</b>
  - <b>How to do threading and getting more used to C</b>
  - <b>Learned about testing a C program by Python</b>
  - <b>Learned about timing a program.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>I think getting rid of sub and neg was a very good choice. It would have been just a repetitive work. </b>
  - <b>Show the command to run the unittest from root folder</b>
  - <b>I think adding how much speed up to expect on how large a matrix would be a good idea.</b>
  - <b>Change the exponentiation link to the Wikipedia link or something more easy to read would be good choice.</b>
  - <b>Maybe for Task 2, similar to task 3 add all the useful function that we need</b>
  - <b>For testing add and example of catching an error type.</b>
  - <b>For PyNumber Struct add this link, it is great: https://py3c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext-types.html</b>
  - <b>For parallel threading say that the inner-most for-loop is going to be a slow-down.

### If you worked with a partner:
- In one short paragraph, describe your contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>I did everything on my own.</b>
  - <b>For Numc I first looked through the existing code to know 
    how to use the python function and then tried to replicate something similar.
    First started on add and did the error case and created a numc.matrix and went on
    from there. Other functions were similar. I did some googling to figure out what
    some python functions were doing and how to use them. Had to do testing after I wrote all
    the functions becuase I didn't know it depended on get and set which I did last.</b>
  - <b>For matrix.c speed up I first started with SIMD on add and parallized it and the
    moved on to mul and abs and then at the end did pow exponentiation.</b>
  - <b>Did some testing, did some coding on matrix.c and numc.c</b>
- In one short paragraph, describe your partner's contribution(s) to the project.
  - <b>My partner was a bum. He did nothing. </b>
  - <b>Just kidding I did the project solo.</b>
